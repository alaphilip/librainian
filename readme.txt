Description:
This project uses Django, Python, HTML, CSS, SQLite and TKinter to create a 'bookstore'.
You should initialise the program by running start.py in the main project folder.
I was asked to create a menu for the user - all this functionality is present on the HTML page.
Longer term I plan to edit this program to repurpose it as a personal library manager.

Installation:
No additional programs should be required for the anticipated code reviewer.
This means I anticipate the user will be able to run Python and Django.

Additional step if you're viewing this on Github viewers:
If you are not the intended reviewer of this code, note you will need to install Python and Django first.
You will also need the secret key used to create this program in order to run it.
I have obscured that in my Github upload.
If you need it, ask and you will receive.

Usage:
Run start.py.
Select the option to start server.
Your browser should open.
You can then add, delete and edit books and book information, as well as searching for books.
If required, use admin and adm1n as login credentials.
