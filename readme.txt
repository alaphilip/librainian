Description:
This project uses Django, Python, HTML, CSS, SQLite and TKinter to create a 'bookstore'.
You should initialise the program by running start.py in the main project folder.
I was asked to create a menu for the user - all this functionality is present on the HTML page.
Longer term I plan to edit this program to repurpose it as a personal library manager.

Installation:
No additional programs should be required for the anticipated code reviewer.
This means I anticipate the user will be able to run Python and Django.

Usage:
Run start.py.
Select the option to start server.
Your browser should open.
You can then add, delete and edit books and book information, as well as searching for books.
If required, use admin and adm1n as login credentials.

Credits:
I have used Hyperion Dev's course materials and VSCode Editor as primary sources.

License:
No license required.
